Copyright is a tricky thing and can vary from location to location, 
I am not a lawyer and never have been, do not take this as legal advice.

By default, you own what you make, and have protections against what others can do and create with your work.
What is written here is not strictly legally binding but can serve to specify what certain groups may do with your pack.
You do not need to write anything here or even keep this file as you already own your pack and do not legally need to state "All Rights Reserved" for it to apply.

Anyone who attempts to install this heropack on a server will be forced to agree to this license before installation can begin.





Below is a template license that I and several others use for heropacks.
 If you do use this license be sure to change the bracketed text to fit your heropack.
